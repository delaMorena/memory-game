# memory-game

### I´ve created this memory game to help my 7 years old kid to learn by heart the multiplication tables. 
#### it´s coded with vanilla js
#### UX UI is improvable but this is just the first approach

`He knows and understand the logic behind multiplications, it´s just that it is too booring for him to just memorizing them
